                <p> Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? 
                    I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. 
                    It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the 
                    Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence
                     the midichlorians to create lifeâ€¦ He had such a knowledge of the 
                     dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about 
                     from dying.</p>
